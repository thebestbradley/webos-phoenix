# Web app runtime

Phoenix runs web apps: the original Open webOS apps (Enyo 1.0, 2011–2012)
and new Phoenix apps (Settings, Phone, ...). This page explains how they run
in the simulator, in a desktop browser, and on a device.

## Where the apps come from

| Source | What | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `third_party/core-apps` | Accounts, Calculator, Calendar, Clock, Contacts, Email, Memos | Apache-2.0 |
| `third_party/enyo-1.0` | The Enyo 1.0 framework they are written in | Apache-2.0 |
| `third_party/foundation-frameworks`, `loadable-frameworks`, `mojoloader`, `underscore` | Shared libraries loaded with MojoLoader (Calendar, Contacts, ...) | Apache-2.0 |
| `third_party/app-services` | The apps' background services (accounts, contacts, calendar reminders, email) | Apache-2.0 |
| `third_party/luna-applauncher`, `luna-systemui` | Original Just Type and system alert UIs | Apache-2.0 |
| `apps/` | New Phoenix apps | Apache-2.0 |

The `third_party` directories are git submodules of the original repositories,
unmodified. After cloning, run:

```sh
git submodule update --init
```

These apps are the **webOS 3.x (TouchPad) versions**, the only ones Palm/HP
open-sourced, so some are laid out for a 1024×768 tablet. Phone layouts are
part of porting them.

## The virtual webOS filesystem

The original apps load their framework from device paths such as
`/usr/palm/frameworks/enyo/0.10/framework/enyo.js`. `runtime/rootfs.json` maps
every device path to a directory in this repository, following the layout of
the Open webOS desktop build (`openwebos/build-desktop`):

- `mounts`: device path prefix → repository directory
- `applicationDirs`: directories whose children are apps (`appinfo.json`, or
  `dist/appinfo.json` for built apps), served at `/usr/palm/applications/<id>/`
- `overlays`: directories laid out like the device (`compat/rootfs/usr/...`)
  whose files win over everything else. Fixes and missing files for the
  original apps go here, so `third_party` stays pristine.

## phoenix-runtime.js

Web apps expect the device's web runtime to provide `PalmSystem` (app and
window info, banners, locale, ...) and `PalmServiceBridge` (calls on the Luna
service bus). `runtime/phoenix-runtime.js` runs before the app's own scripts:

- **On a webOS OSE device**, WebAppMgr provides both. The runtime only renames
  the legacy services that OSE registers under new names
  (`com.palm.systemservice` → `com.webos.service.systemservice`,
  `com.palm.applicationManager` → `com.webos.applicationManager`,
  `com.palm.connectionmanager` → `com.webos.service.connectionmanager`).
  OSE still registers db8 as `com.palm.db` and `com.palm.tempdb`.
- **In the simulator or a browser**, it provides both itself, with simulated
  services that store their data in localStorage: db8 (`put`, `get`, `merge`,
  `del`, `find`/`search` with `where`/`orderBy`/`limit`, `watch`), system
  service (time, preferences), application manager (launch, open), connection
  manager, power, accounts, and harmless stubs for the rest. Calls to a
  service it doesn't know return an error and are logged once.

Pages talk to the shell (launch another app, show a banner) through
`phoenixHost.postToHost(type, payload)`. In phoenix-sim that arrives as a
console message with the `__phoenix__` prefix.

The Settings app's services (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, settings service, audio, ...)
are simulated in their own clearly marked block at the end of the runtime;
see [Settings](#settings) below.

## Running apps

**In the simulator.** Build `phoenix-sim` with Qt WebEngine (Homebrew's `qt`
includes it; on Ubuntu install `qt6-webengine-dev qml6-module-qtwebengine`).
The apps then appear in the launcher and quick launch with their original
icons.

```sh
./build/phoenix-sim --launch com.palm.app.notes
```

Windows an app opens (`window.open`, `enyo.windows.activate`) become new cards
in that app's stack. Headless apps (`"noWindow": true` in `appinfo.json`, e.g.
Calendar, Clock, Email) run their main page invisibly, and each window they
open is a card, as on webOS.

**In a desktop browser.**

```sh
tools/serve-rootfs.py        # then open http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

This serves the same filesystem and adds the runtime to every app page. It's
handy for debugging an app with the browser's developer tools.

**Automated check.** `node tools/test-apps.cjs [--tablet]` loads every app in
headless Chromium, follows the windows headless apps open, and fails if an app
marked as working in `tools/app-expectations.json` stops starting cleanly.
Screenshots go to `build/app-tests/`.

## Status of the original apps

See `tools/app-expectations.json` for the current list. Calculator, Clock and
Memos start cleanly; Accounts, Calendar, Contacts and Email need more of the
simulated services, and Contacts references two source files missing from the
Open webOS release.
Phoenix Settings (`org.webosphoenix.settings` and its launch points) starts
cleanly on phone and tablet; `node tools/test-settings.cjs [--tablet]` also
drives it (Wi-Fi, password, PIN, brightness, airplane mode, Bluetooth).

## Phoenix apps (React + TypeScript)

New Phoenix apps live in `apps/`, an npm workspace:

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/shared/luna` (`@phoenix/luna`) | Typed client for `PalmServiceBridge`: `call()` returns a promise, `subscribe()` a cancellable subscription, errors are `LunaError`s. `types.ts` types the OSE methods the apps use; `services.ts` wraps them (`wifi.connect()`, `bluetooth.pair()`, ...), each citing the OSE source it follows; `@phoenix/luna/react` has `useLuna()` and `useLaunchParams()` |
| `apps/shared/phoenix-ui` (`@phoenix/ui`) | React components with the webOS 1.x/2.x look, drawn with the Enyo 1.0 "Heritage" artwork (copied into `assets/enyo`, see its `PROVENANCE.md`): `PageHeader`, `Group`, `Row`, `Divider`, `ToggleButton`, `Slider`, `ListSelector`, `Picker`, `PopupMenu`, `Button`, `Drawer`, `DividerDrawer`, `Dialog`, `Spinner`, `TextField` |
| `apps/settings` | Settings (see below) |

Build (Node.js 20 or newer):

```sh
cd apps
npm ci
npm run build       # every app into apps/<name>/dist/
npm test            # vitest: the Luna client (also against the simulated services) and components
npm run typecheck
```

`cmake --build` runs the same (`npm ci` when `package-lock.json` changes, then
`npm run build`) through the `phoenix-apps` target when npm is installed;
`-DPHOENIX_BUILD_APPS=OFF` turns it off. For live reloading while working on
an app, `npm run dev -w @phoenix/settings` serves it with Vite (without the
runtime: open it through `tools/serve-rootfs.py` to get the simulated services).

Each app's `dist/` is a complete webOS app (`appinfo.json`, `index.html`,
icons, relative asset paths), so `runtime/rootfs.json`'s `applicationDirs`
entry for `apps` picks it up. `dist/` and `node_modules/` are not committed.

### Launcher metadata and launch points

`appinfo.json` may have a `phoenix` object, read by `shell/sim/rootfs.cpp` and
`tools/serve-rootfs.py`:

```json
"phoenix": {
    "launcherTab": 2,
    "hidden": true,
    "launchPoints": [
        { "id": "org.webosphoenix.settings.wifi", "title": "Wi-Fi", "icon": "icons/wifi.png", "params": { "page": "wifi" } }
    ]
}
```

- `launcherTab`: 0 Apps (default), 1 Downloads, 2 Settings
- `hidden`: leave the app itself out of the launcher (its launch points stay)
- `launchPoints`: extra launcher icons for the same app. Each is its own
  card and starts the app with `params` as its launch params
  (`PalmSystem.launchParams`, `?launchParams=` on the page URL). A web app
  whose title matches a placeholder (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ...) replaces it.

On OSE, the same launch points are registered with SAM
(`com.webos.applicationManager/addLaunchPoint`), and launch params arrive the
same way. When the shell launches an app that is already running with new
params, the page gets OSE's `webOSRelaunch` document event
(`__phoenixRuntime.relaunch()` in the simulator); `useLaunchParams()` handles
both. A `launch` host message (`applicationManager/launch {id, params}`) whose
params match a launch point opens that launch point's card.

## Settings

`apps/settings` is one app with one launch point per pane, like the separate
preference apps of webOS 2.x: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Airplane Mode, Screen & Lock,
Sounds & Ringtones, Date & Time, Language & Region, Device Info, Updates.
Launched without a page it lists them all. The launcher icons are drawn by
`apps/settings/tools/render-icons.cjs` and the wallpapers by
`tools/make-wallpapers.py` (CC0); Palm's were never open-sourced.

### Services

The app codes against webOS OSE's services, checked against their sources
(webosose GitHub). The simulator implements exactly these calls, with the
same request and reply shapes:

| Pane | Service and methods | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wi-Fi | `com.webos.service.wifi`: `setstate`, `getstatus`, `findnetworks`, `connect` (`ssid` + `security.simpleSecurity.passKey`, or `profileId`; error 10 = wrong password), `deleteprofile` | `webos-connman-adapter` `src/wifi_service.c` |
| Airplane Mode | `com.webos.service.connectionmanager`: `getstatus` (`offlineMode`), `setstate {offlineMode}` | `webos-connman-adapter` `src/connectionmanager_service.c` |
| Bluetooth | `com.webos.service.bluetooth2`: `adapter/getStatus`, `adapter/setState {powered}`, `adapter/startDiscovery`, `adapter/cancelDiscovery`, `adapter/pair`, `adapter/unpair`, `device/getStatus` | `com.webos.service.bluetooth2` `src/bluetoothmanagerservice.cpp`, `bluetoothmanageradapter.cpp` |
| Screen & Lock | `com.webos.settingsservice` `get/setSystemSettings {category: "picture", backlight}`; `com.webos.service.systemservice` `get/setPreferences` (`screenTimeout`, `rotationLock`, `wallpaper`, `showAlertsWhenLocked`, `blinkNotifications`) | `settingsservice` `inc/SettingsServiceApi.h`; `luna-sysservice` `Src/PrefsFactory.cpp` (stores any key) |
| Screen & Lock (PIN) | `com.palm.systemmanager` `getDeviceLockMode`, `setDevicePasscode`, `matchDevicePasscode`: the legacy webOS API; OSE has none, so Phoenix will have to provide it | `openwebos/luna-sysmgr` `Src/base/SystemService.cpp` |
| Sounds | `com.webos.service.audio` `master/getVolume`, `master/setVolume`, `master/muteVolume`, `getInputVolume` / `setInputVolume` (`streamType` `pringtones`, `palerts`, `pmedia`), `playFeedback`; system service `ringtone`, `systemSounds` | `audiod-pro` `src/modules/masterVolumeManager`, `audioPolicyManager`, `systemSoundsManager` |
| Date & Time | system service `get/setPreferences` (`timeFormat`, `useNetworkTime`, `useNetworkTimeZone`, `timeZone`), `getPreferenceValues {key: "timeZone"}`, `time/getSystemTime`, `time/setSystemTime {utc}` | `luna-sysservice` `Src/TimePrefsHandler.cpp` |
| Language & Region | `com.webos.settingsservice` `get/setSystemSettings {keys: ["localeInfo"]}` (`locales.UI`, `locales.FMT`) | `settingsservice` |
| Device Info | system service `deviceInfo/query`, `osInfo/query`; `com.palm.power` `batteryStatusQuery` (legacy); settings service `resetSystemSettings`; `org.webosphoenix.service.reset/eraseUserData` (Phoenix, simulator only so far) | `luna-sysservice` `Src/DeviceInfoService.cpp`, `OsInfoService.cpp` |

The simulated services keep their state in the runtime's store (shared by
every app window, persistent across restarts) and have a few simulated
networks and devices. Passwords that work: `Phoenix` = `phoenix123`,
`Lab 5G` = `webos2009`, `Neighbor` = `12345`.

### The shell in the simulator

Settings and the status bar stay in step:

1. Whenever a radio, airplane mode, brightness, mute, rotation lock or the
   wallpaper changes, and when a page starts, the runtime posts
   `systemStatus` (`wifiEnabled`, `wifiConnected`, `wifiBars`, `bluetoothOn`,
   `airplaneMode`, `brightness` 0-100, `rotationLocked`, `muted`,
   `wallpaperFile`).
2. `SimWindowSource` turns the wallpaper's device path into a file URL and
   emits `systemStatusReported(status)`; `sim.qml` applies it with
   `SimSystemStatus.applyAppStatus()` and sets the shell wallpaper.
3. When the user changes something in the system menu, `sim.qml` sends just
   that key (`SimSystemStatus.appStatusFor()`) to every web page with
   `SimWindowSource.pushSystemStatus()`, which runs
   `__phoenixRuntime.applyHostStatus({...})`. The runtime applies it (airplane
   mode also switches the radios off) and answers with one `systemStatus`.
   Changes made while no web page runs wait for the next page to load.

Without Qt WebEngine none of this runs and the system menu works on its own.
On a device, `LsmSystemStatus` would subscribe to the same OSE services
instead (Milestone 1).
